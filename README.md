# Rate monotonic scheduler

This program was created for the embedded systems class in the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. (BME - Be치gyazott inform치ci칩s rendszerek h치zi feladat)
It is emulating a scheduler for some example Tasks. 

Every task has a name, a periodic time, a calculation time, and a starting phaze. The scheduler always starts at 0. 

The program generates the output as a text and saves it in the output.txt file. This can be opened in an excel spreadsheet and can be visualized like below:
